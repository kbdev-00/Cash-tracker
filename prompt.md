## AI Prompts Used

AI tools were used strictly for **learning, debugging, and conceptual guidance** during development.  
No code was blindly copied; all logic was written, tested, and integrated manually to ensure proper understanding of core JavaScript concepts.

The following prompts were used during the development process:

- “How to manage application state and update the DOM efficiently using vanilla JavaScript?”
- “What is the correct way to store and retrieve arrays and objects using browser localStorage?”
- “How can Chart.js data be updated dynamically without destroying and recreating the chart?”
- “How to generate and customize PDF reports in JavaScript using the jsPDF library?”
- “How to convert currency values in real time using a free, keyless exchange rate API?”
- “How to handle user input validation and prevent incorrect data entry in JavaScript forms?”
- “How to optimize DOM manipulation to improve performance when adding or deleting list items?”

All application logic, UI updates, and feature implementations were completed manually.  
AI assistance was used only to clarify concepts, debug issues, and follow best practices.
